# Random_SpecSelect


This repository has the files necissary to select three random spectra from a k-means clustering produced Raman spectroscopy map.
I collected the data using a Renishaw spectrometer, and the maps I collected were already pre-processed in Wire and saved in txt. file format.

To use the file, pull/download all three, Raman_SpecSelect Jupyter notebook, common_functions.py, and CLuster.py into the same file.
Add your map data to the same folder as the files, and add the folder location and your data name into the indicated sections.
